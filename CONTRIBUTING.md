To ensure that your contribution benefits the project and other users, be sure to follow these guidelines before creating a Pull Request (PR):
- **Use Useful Changes:**
  Make sure the fixes or features you add are useful to other users and improve the project as a whole.
- **Do Not Modify Files in the ``dist`` Folder:**
  - Files in the ``dist`` folder should not be modified directly.
  - Unless you are adding new folders to the ``dist``, do not make any changes inside these folders.
- **Modify Only in ``src`` or ``js`` Folder:**
  - All code changes must be made in the ``src`` or ``js`` folder.
- **Compile Code Before Making PR:**
  - Make sure to compile the files in the ``src`` folder before creating a PR.
  - This ensures that your changes can be deployed in the distributed version without any problems.
