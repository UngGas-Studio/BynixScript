# Roadmap
As the creator of BynixScript, I want to convey the BynixScript roadmap. In the future I want this programming language to be **completely self-hosting**, have **clear documentation**, **support basic programming language functions**, and **have functions that are not in JavaScript**.
- **Completely self-hosting** BynixScript will be written with BynixScript itself, even though what is used as a system is the compilation result.
- **Clear documentation**
Gradually all BynixScript documentation will be clarified, so that old and new users can understand better.
- **Supports basic programming language functions**
BynixScript will support basic programming language functions that are important and must be in BynixScript.
- **Has functions that do not exist in JavaScript**
BynixScript will provide functions that are not available in JavaScript
